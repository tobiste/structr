\description{
Fault from rake and quadrant notation
}
\details{
\code{type=="plunge"} This is the angle measured in the fault plane between the
strike given by either right or left hand rule and the lineation.
The angle is recorded in a clockwise sense (looking down upon the fault plane) and has a range
from 0 to 180\%deg;. The quadrant of plunge indicates the direction
of the strike from which the angle of pitch is measured.

\code{type=="rake"} Rake is the acute angle measured in the fault plane between the strike of the fault and the
lineation . Starting from the strike line, the angle is measured in a sense
which is down the dip of the plane. Quadrant of pitch The variable is used to
indicate the direction of the strike from which the angle of pitch is measured.
Angle ranges from 0 to 90 Â°
