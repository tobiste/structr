\usage{
exponential_kamb(cos_dist, sigma = 3)

linear_inverse_kamb(cos_dist, sigma = 3)

square_inverse_kamb(cos_dist, sigma = 3)

kamb_count(cos_dist, sigma = 3)

schmidt_count(cos_dist, sigma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cos_dist}{cosine distances}

\item{sigma}{(optional) numeric. The number of standard deviations defining the expected number of
standard deviations by which a random sample from a uniform
distribution of points would be expected to vary from being evenly
distributed across the hemisphere.  This controls the size of the
counting circle, and therefore the degree of smoothing.  Higher sigmas
will lead to more smoothing of the resulting density distribution. This
parameter only applies to Kamb-based methods.  Defaults to 3.}

\details{
\code{\link[=exponential_kamb]{exponential_kamb()}}: Kamb with exponential smoothing
A modified Kamb method using exponential smoothing (ref1). Units are
in numbers of standard deviations by which the density estimate
differs from uniform.

\code{\link[=linear_inverse_kamb]{linear_inverse_kamb()}}: Kamb with linear smoothing
A modified Kamb method using linear smoothing (ref1).  Units are in
numbers of standard deviations by which the density estimate differs from uniform.

\code{\link[=square_inverse_kamb]{square_inverse_kamb()}}: Kamb with squared smoothing
A modified Kamb method using squared smoothing (ref1).  Units are in
numbers of standard deviations by which the density estimate differs from uniform.

\code{\link[=kamb_count]{kamb_count()}}: Kamb with no smoothing
Kamb's method (ref2) with no smoothing. Units are in numbers of standard
deviations by which the density estimate differs from uniform.

\code{\link[=schmidt_count]{schmidt_count()}}: 1\% counts. The traditional "Schmidt" (a.k.a. 1\%) method.
Counts points within a counting circle comprising 1\% of the total area of the
hemisphere. Does not take into account sample size.  Units are in points per 1\% area.
