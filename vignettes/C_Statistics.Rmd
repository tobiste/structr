This tutorial describes how to calculate basic statistics for spherical orientation data using the `{structr}` package. It covers the calculation of mean orientations, dispersion measures, hypothesis testing, orientation tensors, and clustering of orientation data.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Load the package:
```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(structr)
```

To start, we import some example planes and lines, and convert them to spherical objects:
```{r example}
data(example_planes_df)
data(example_lines_df)

planes <- Plane(example_planes_df$dipdir, example_planes_df$dip)
lines <- Line(example_lines_df$trend, example_lines_df$plunge)
```

## Mean and dispersion
Arithmetic mean, geodesic mean, and projected mean

### Arithmetic mean and variance

The arithmetic mean orientation of spherical data is calculated by summing up all orientation vectors and normalizing the resulting vector. 

In geology, the statistical estimators are useful for **vectorial data** (`"Line"` objects) such as lineations (e.g. mineral lineations, stretching lineations) or plunge directions of fold axes, but less for axial data (`"Ray"` objects) such as paleomagnetic directions or orientations of fold axes, where the direction is not relevant.

These estimators are good descriptors of the concentration of the data around the mean direction, assuming a unimodal, isotropic distributions such as the *von Mises-Fisher distribution*.

Define some weights for our lines based on the quality reported for the measurements:
```{r stat0}    
example_lines_df$quality <- ifelse(is.na(example_lines_df$quality), 6, example_lines_df$quality) # replacing NA values with 6
line_weightings <- 6 / example_lines_df$quality
```


The (weighted) arithmetic mean orientation of spherical data is:

```{r stat_mean}
lines_mean <- sph_mean(lines, w = line_weightings)
```

... and the (weighted) arithmetic variance

```{r stat_var}
lines_variance <- sph_var(lines, w = line_weightings)
```

the (weighted) standard deviation (i.e. the 63% cone around the mean) and the 95% confidence cone around the mean:

```{r stat_delta}
lines_delta <- delta(lines, w = line_weightings)
lines_confangle <- sph_confidence_angle(lines, w = line_weightings)
```

Taken together, this prints as
```{r stat}
c(
  "Variance" = lines_variance,
  "63% cone" = lines_delta,
  "Confidence angle" = lines_confangle
)
```

Summary stats can also be retrieved through
```{r summary}
summary(lines)
```

Plotting a summary of the stats on a equal-area projection:
```{r stat_plot, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Diagram showing statistical results of some example data plotted in an
#|   equal-area projection
stereoplot(guides = FALSE)
points(lines, col = "lightgrey", pch = 1, cex = .5)
points(lines_mean, col = "#B63679", pch = 19, cex = 1)
lines(lines_mean, ang = lines_confangle, col = "#E65164FF")
lines(lines_mean, ang = lines_delta, col = "#FB8861FF")
legend("topright", legend = c("Mean line", "95% confidence cone", "63% data cone"), col = c("#B63679", "#E65164FF", "#FB8861FF"), pch = c(19, NA, NA), lty = c(NA, 1, 1), cex = .75)
```

### Geodesic mean and variance
Another measure of mean and dispersion is the  *Fr&#233;chet (geodesic L<sup>2</sup>) mean* and *variance* which is based on the angles between all data vectors.  
This can be visualized using the `variance_plot()`; here showing the (geodesic) angle distances between all lines and the first line in the same data set:

```{r variance}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Diagram showing the distances of a set of vectors to a specified vector
variance_plot(lines, y = lines[1, ])
```

> The Fr&#233;chet mean is the vector that minimizes the sum of the squared angle distances to all data vectors.
> The Fr&#233;chet variance about this mean is the sum of the squared angle distances between all data vectors and the Fr&#233;chet mean.

To find the Fr&#233;chet mean vector, the algorithm iteratively searches for the vector by using a numerical optimization method to minimize the distances to all other vectors 

```{r geodesic}
# Mean
geodesic_mean(lines)

# Variance
geodesic_var(lines)
```

These estimators are good descriptors of the concentration of the data around the mean direction, when data follows a unimodal, anisotropic distributions such as the *Kent* or *Bingham distributions*.

### Projected mean

The Eigenvector with the largest Eigenvalue represents a vector parallel to the highest concentration of a population. This vector can also be described as the **projected mean**. A shortcut function for this is:

```{r projected}
projected_mean(example_lines)
```

These estimators are good descriptors of the concentration of the data around the mean direction, when data follows a unimodal, anisotropic distributions such as the *Kent* or *Bingham distributions*.


```{r mean_plot}
#| fig.alt: >
#|  Equal area projections showing the different estimators of the mean

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
stereoplot(guides = FALSE)
points(example_lines, col = "grey", pch = 16, cex = .7)
points(sph_mean(example_lines), col = "#1D1147FF", pch = 16)
points(geodesic_mean(example_lines), col = "#B63679FF", pch = 16)
points(projected_mean(example_lines), col = "#FEC287FF", pch = 16)
title(main = "Lines")

legend("bottomleft",
  legend = c("Arithmetic mean", "Geodesic mean", "Projected mean"),
  col = c("#1D1147FF", "#B63679FF", "#FEC287FF"),
  pch = 16,
  bg = "white"
)

stereoplot(guides = FALSE)
points(example_planes, col = "grey", pch = 16, cex = .7)
points(sph_mean(example_planes), col = "#1D1147FF", pch = 16)
points(geodesic_mean(example_planes), col = "#B63679FF", pch = 16)
points(projected_mean(example_planes), col = "#FEC287FF", pch = 16)
title(main = "Planes")
```


### Hypothesis testing
To test if a line represents the population mean of a given set of lineations, we need to calculate the confidence region of our population.

Let's test the hypothesis that a horizontal lineation trending towards 70&deg; is the mean for our lineations.

```{r test0}
line_NULL <- Line(70, 0)
```

The 95% confidence interval (from 10,000 bootstrap samples):
```{r test1}
ce <- confidence_ellipse(lines, n = 10000, alpha = 0.05)
```

To visualize the confidence region of our lines:
```{r test2}
#| fig.alt: Diagram showing the confidence region of a mean
plot(lines, col = "grey")
stereo_confidence(ce, col = "#B63679FF")
points(line_NULL, col = "#000004", pch = 16)
```

The p-value for our hypothesis line:
```{r test3}
ce$pvalue.FUN(line_NULL)
```

With (95% confidence) we rejected the Null Hypothesis that the given line represents the population mean as the p-value is smaller than 5%.


## Orientation tensor 
### Eigenvectors

The orientation tensor (Scheidegger 1965) is a matrix comprising the mean direction cosines of the orientation vectors. In case of a Bingham distribution, the **Eigenvectors** of this tensor describe the orientation of the most dense, intermediate and least dense orientation, and thus, are used to determine the orientation of girdle-distributed vectors (e.g. folded planes).

#### Shape parameters
There are more shape parameters using different algorithms based on the orientation tensor:

```{r shapes}
or_shape_params(planes)
```


## Cluster vectors

To find k clusters of orientational data, the `sph_cluster()` function can be used:

```{r cluster}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Stereoplot showing the the cluster result of an example dataset

# generate some random vectors:
set.seed(20250411)
x1 <- rvmf(100, mu = Line(90, 0), k = 20)
x2 <- rvmf(100, mu = Line(0, 0), k = 20)
x3 <- rvmf(100, mu = Line(0, 90), k = 20)
x123 <- rbind(x1, x2, x3)

# cluster the vectors:
cl <- sph_cluster(x123, k = 3)

# visualize the result:
plot(x123, col = assign_col_d(cl$cluster))

legend_d(assign_col_d(unique(cl$cluster)), title = "Cluster")
```
