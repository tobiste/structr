`{structr}` is a free and open-source package for R that provides tools for structural geology. You can

- analyze and visualize orientation data of structural geology (including, stereographic projections, contouring, fabric plots, and statistics),

- cluster analysis of orientation data

- analyze stress (including visualization of the magnitudes of stress in the Mohr circle and extracting the maximum horizontal stress of a 3D stress tensor),

- reconstruct the orientation of structures in oriented drill cores using the alpha, beta, and gamma angles, and

- calculate fault displacement components

- contouring geologic fabric and finite strain data on the unit hyperboloids

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{structr}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tobiste/structr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to import data and plot them on a sterographic projection.

```{r stereo, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(structr)
library(ggplot2)
library(mapproj)

data(example_planes)
planes <- Plane(example_planes$dipdir, example_planes$dip)

fabric <- or_shape_params(planes)$Vollmer["D"]

ggstereo() +
  geom_contourf_stereo(gg(planes)) +
  geom_point(data = gg(planes), aes(x, y), color = "grey", shape = 21) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "F") +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Example data",
    title = "Density contour plot",
    fill = "Multiples of\nvon Mises-Fisher\ndistribution",
    caption = paste0("Equal area, lower hemisphere projection | N: ", nrow(planes), " | Fabric strength: ", round(fabric, 2))
  )
```
